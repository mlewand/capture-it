# Capture It

A simple app to instantly add notes to your todo list.

Main goals of the app:

* Lighting fast, above all - it has to pop up and disappear in a blink of an eye.
* Easy - start with limited set of features.
* Quick to develop - new ideas should be implemented fast and easy.

It wasn't mean to be a state of art app, so the source code has shortcuts and is messy in many places.

## Variants

Following application variants are available:

* [Desktop](packages/capture-it-desktop-app) - based on Electron
* [Mobile](packages/capture-it-mobile-app) - based on React Native
